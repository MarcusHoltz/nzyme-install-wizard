# Nzyme Install Wizard

There are a few gotchas in the [documentation](https://v1.nzyme.org/docs/intro) to get nzyme up and running. 

I would like the install and configuration of nzyme be as easy as it's use. **This install script intends to fix that.**


## Install nzyme with this wizard

Use [the install script](./nzyme-install-wizard.sh) to help guide you through nzyme install process.

> The goal of nzyme is to be accessible to as many people as possible by being easy to understand, no matter your level of experience.


### Install with this command:

* * *

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcusHoltz/nzyme-install-wizard/main/nzyme-install-wizard.sh; chmod +x nzyme-install-wizard.sh; bash nzyme-install-wizard.sh
```

* * *


#### Thanks, good luck!
