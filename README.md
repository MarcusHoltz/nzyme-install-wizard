## Install nzyme with this wizard

Use the install script to help guide through nzyme install process.

There are a few gotchas in the [documentation](https://v1.nzyme.org/docs/intro) to get nzyme up and running. 

I would like the install and configuration of nzyme be as easy as it's use. The install script intends to fix that.
